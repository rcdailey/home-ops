## Resources

### Implementation Plans

#### Service Migration Methodology

**Systematic Analysis Workflow**: For each service migration, we follow this proven 4-step process using the app-scout tool and Claude for analysis:

1. **Chart Discovery**: `scripts/app-scout.sh discover <service-name>` - Find available charts and app-template examples
2. **Configuration Analysis**: `scripts/app-scout.sh inspect <service-name> --repo <repo-name> --files helmrelease,values` - Fetch specific repository's configuration
3. **Docker Compose Comparison**: Claude analyzes current Docker Compose setup vs Helm chart capabilities, storage requirements, network configuration, environment variables and secrets management
4. **Migration Decision & Implementation**: Based on analysis, Claude recommends best chart option, required repository additions to Flux, HelmRelease configuration following repository patterns

**Chart Selection Strategy**: Primary choice is bjw-s app-template (6,395+ community deployments) for consistent patterns and maximum flexibility. Secondary choice is official Helm charts for complex applications with significant operational value.

#### Authentik Migration Plan

**Migration Strategy**: Parallel deployment with gradual service transition to avoid disrupting 12+ authenticated Docker services managed by SWAG auto proxy.

**Directory Structure**: kubernetes/apps/default/authentik/ with self-contained authentication stack including HelmRepository + HelmRelease + values in single helmrelease.yaml file.

**Stack Components**: Single HelmRelease deploying complete Authentik ecosystem - PostgreSQL database backend, Redis task queue and caching, Authentik Server web UI and API endpoints, Authentik Worker background task processing.

**Deployment Phases**:
- Phase 1: Deploy K8s Authentik with auth-test.${SECRET_DOMAIN} subdomain for parallel testing
- Phase 2: As each Docker service migrates to K8s, update authentication integration
- Phase 3: Switch K8s Authentik to auth.${SECRET_DOMAIN} and export/import user data

### Configuration Patterns

#### Homer ConfigMap Management Solution

**Problem**: Homer deployment initially failed due to ConfigMap reference issues between Kustomize hash suffixes and app-template HelmRelease references.

**Solution**: Selected disableNameSuffixHash + Reloader approach based on community recommendations. ConfigMap always named `homer-config` (predictable), Reloader handles automatic pod restarts on config changes.

**Implementation**:
```yaml
# kustomization.yaml
configMapGenerator:
  - name: homer-config
    files:
      - config/config.yml
generatorOptions:
  disableNameSuffixHash: true

# helmrelease.yaml
values:
  controllers:
    homer:
      annotations:
        reloader.stakater.com/auto: "true"
  persistence:
    config:
      name: homer-config
      type: configMap
```

### Tool References

**App Scout**: `scripts/app-scout.sh` - Discovery commands (JSON output) and configuration fetching (human-readable output). Database files (repos.db, repos-extended.db) stored in scripts directory. Data source: kubesearch.dev community repository index.

## Progress & Context Log

### 2025-07-11 - Memory Bank System Rules Enhancement and Template Structure Correction

Enhanced memory bank system rules in @/Users/robert/.local/share/chezmoi/home/dot_claude/memory-bank/system.md with template structure compliance enforcement and comprehensive consolidation across all sections, not just Progress Log.

New rules added: Template Structure Compliance section with authorized top-level sections enforcement, Resources sub-section organization requirements, structure violation correction protocol. Enhanced File Consolidation Protocol with comprehensive decision tree covering Progress Log, Resources section, and Task Checklist consolidation. Added file size management targets and triggers.

Updated verification checklist to include template structure compliance verification and comprehensive consolidation performance requirements. File size targets: active sessions 300-500 lines maximum, Resources section 100-150 lines maximum.

Template structure corrected: Restructured existing memory bank file to comply with enhanced rules by moving unauthorized top-level sections (Service Migration Methodology, Homer ConfigMap Management Solution, Authentik Migration Plan) under Resources as sub-sections. Consolidated Phase 1 completed tasks into single summary. Reduced file size from 601 lines to 230 lines while preserving all technical details, decisions, and rationale.

Status updates: Phase 1 Infrastructure Foundation complete with 12/275 items finished. Ready to begin Phase 2 authentication infrastructure starting with Authentik deployment with parallel testing subdomain, PostgreSQL and Redis backend components, authentication flow testing, and gradual service migration planning.

### 2025-07-10 - CUPS Service Removal and Infrastructure Cleanup

Completed comprehensive removal of CUPS print server from Kubernetes cluster due to persistent systemd socket activation issues with Docker 23.x containers. Decision made to deploy CUPS externally rather than continue troubleshooting container limitations.

Kubernetes cleanup: Removed all CUPS application files, deleted CUPS ks.yaml file, updated default namespace kustomization. Talos configuration reversion: Removed ulimit patch file, removed patch reference from talconfig.yaml, applied configuration changes to nami node removing baseRuntimeSpecOverrides.

Repository code quality enhancement: Implemented comprehensive improvements through 8 logical commits including pre-commit hooks with YAML validation, kustomize build checks, kubectl dry-run validation, yamllint configuration optimized for Kubernetes manifests. Enhanced app-scout script with improved type hints and file discovery capabilities.

### 2025-07-09 - CUPS Print Server Deployment Troubleshooting

Successfully deployed CUPS print server to Kubernetes with comprehensive troubleshooting and configuration fixes. Fixed Docker 23.x NOFILE limit issue by implementing baseRuntimeSpecOverrides in Talos configuration setting RLIMIT_NOFILE to 65536 for nami node.

Resolved HelmRelease stalling by restarting Flux controllers and forcing proper Kustomization reconciliation. Fixed SECRET_DOMAIN variable substitution and removed problematic UDP port configuration causing NodePort conflicts.

Core issue identified: Even with proper Docker 23.x NOFILE limit fix applied at Talos level, CUPS systemd socket activation still failing. Process running but no TCP sockets listening, LoadBalancer IP unreachable.

### 2025-07-06 - Authentik Database Authentication Issues Resolved

Successfully diagnosed and fixed Authentik deployment authentication failures through systematic investigation using kubectl exec commands.

PostgreSQL Issue Resolved: Found authentik user password was not properly set during database initialization. Used postgres superuser to reset authentik user password. Redis Issue Identified: Discovered Redis authentication failures due to missing password configuration in Authentik values.

Authentik Migration Complete: Full deployment successful with working authentication. All components operational - PostgreSQL, Redis, authentik-server, authentik-worker pods Running/Ready. HTTPRoute active at auth-test.dailey.app via Cloudflare tunnel. Admin credentials tested and verified working.

### 2025-07-05 - Authentik Migration Planning and Infrastructure Development

Completed comprehensive Authentik migration planning including analysis, architecture decisions, and repository pattern standardization. Established self-contained application structure following repository conventions with co-located HelmRepository resources.

### 2025-07-04 - NFS Infrastructure Implementation

Completed NFS infrastructure setup with static PersistentVolumes for existing Unraid data. Created comprehensive storage structure with three main PVs: media-pv (100Ti), photos-pv (10Ti), and filerun-pv (5Ti) pointing to existing Nezuko shares.

Implemented security configurations with NFSv4.1 and Private mode for local network access. PVs configured with ReadWriteMany access mode for shared storage access patterns.

### 2025-07-02 - App Scout Research Tooling Implementation

Created comprehensive app-scout.py tool for systematic service migration analysis. Tool provides programmatic access to kubesearch.dev community data with 6,395+ app-template deployments and examples from 38+ repositories.

Implemented 4-step migration methodology: discovery â†’ configuration analysis â†’ Docker Compose comparison â†’ implementation decision. Tool fetches actual HelmRelease and values.yaml files from community repositories for direct configuration comparison.

### 2025-06-30 - Rook Ceph Infrastructure Implementation

Implemented Rook Ceph storage infrastructure following repository conventions. Created complete directory structure with operator and cluster components using official Helm charts. Fixed Talos disk selector ambiguity on rias node with size filter.

Resolved multiple YAML configuration conflicts by analyzing repository patterns and removing inline values from HelmReleases. Added proper top-level monitoring configuration for Helm chart Prometheus integration.

### 2025-06-29 - Session Created
