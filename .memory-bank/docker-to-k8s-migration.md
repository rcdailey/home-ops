  - /mnt/user/filerun - FileRun cloud storage

### Service Categories and Counts
1. Databases & Data Stores (12 services) - PostgreSQL, MariaDB, MongoDB, Redis, Elasticsearch
2. Media Management Suite (13 services) - Plex, *arr stack, downloaders, enhancement tools
3. Web Applications (5 services) - LibreChat, FileRun, Immich, BookStack, Uptime Kuma
4. Infrastructure & Networking (4 services) - SWAG, AdGuard, Cloudflared, Docker proxy
5. Identity & Authentication (2 services) - Authentik server and worker

7. Utilities & Tools (5 services) - Borgmatic, Deck Chores, maintenance utilities
8. Dashboards & Monitoring (1 service) - Homer dashboard

### Services to Skip Migration
- LibreChat stack (4 services) - No longer actively used
- Stash - Skip for now, evaluate later
- Borgmatic - Replace with Kubernetes-native backup solution
- Deck Chores - Replace with Kubernetes CronJobs
- Plex Bloat Fix - Evaluate need in K8s environment

### High-Complexity Migration Considerations
- qBittorrent: Requires VPN connectivity for all traffic
- AdGuard Home: Needs UDP port 53 for DNS (host networking)
- Authentik: Critical dependency for many services
- Plex: Intel GPU access for hardware transcoding
- Media Stack: 13 services with complex networking and shared storage
- Immich Components: Deploy as service group with shared storage strategy

### Timeline Estimates
- Phase 1 (Infrastructure): 1-2 weeks
- Phase 2 (Authentication/Core): 1-2 weeks
- Phase 3 (Media Infrastructure): 2-3 weeks
- Phase 4 (Productivity Apps): 2-3 weeks
- Phase 5 (Utilities): 1 week
- Phase 6 (Optimization): 1 week
- Total Estimated Duration: 8-12 weeks with learning and testing time
