## Next Steps

1. Implement Authentik migration plan with default namespace structure
2. Create centralized email secrets in default/cluster-secrets
3. Deploy Authentik stack using official Helm chart with parallel deployment strategy
4. Test authentication flows with auth-test subdomain before production switch
5. Begin systematic service migration using established app-scout methodology
6. Create persistent volume claims during first application migrations

## Service Migration Methodology

### **Systematic Analysis Workflow**

For each service migration, we follow this proven 4-step process using the app-scout tool and Claude for analysis:

#### **Step 1: Chart Discovery**
```bash
# Find available charts and app-template examples
scripts/app-scout.sh discover <service-name>

# Example output shows:
# - Repository names with star counts
# - Chart types (official vs app-template)
# - URLs to actual configurations
# - Release names and versions
```

#### **Step 2: Configuration Analysis**
```bash
# Fetch specific repository's configuration
scripts/app-scout.sh inspect <service-name> --repo <repo-name> --files helmrelease,values

# Downloads and displays:
# - HelmRelease YAML (Flux integration)
# - values.yaml files (detailed configuration)
# - Companion configuration files
```

#### **Step 3: Docker Compose Comparison**
Claude analyzes:
- Current Docker Compose setup vs Helm chart capabilities
- Storage requirements (NFS mounts, Rook Ceph PVCs)
- Network configuration (ports, ingress, DNS)
- Environment variables and secrets management
- Resource requirements and security contexts
- Hardware requirements (GPU access, special capabilities)

#### **Step 4: Migration Decision & Implementation**
Based on analysis, Claude recommends:
- Best chart option (app-template vs official chart)
- Required repository additions to Flux
- HelmRelease configuration following repository patterns
- Storage class selections and PVC requirements
- Secret management and configuration approach

### **Chart Selection Strategy**

**Primary Choice: bjw-s app-template**
- 6,395+ community deployments
- Consistent patterns across all services
- Maximum flexibility for custom configurations
- Best integration with repository conventions

**Secondary Choice: Official Helm Charts**
- Complex applications (Authentik, databases)
- Charts with significant operational value
- Active maintenance and community support

**Decision Factors:**
1. **Complexity**: Simple apps → app-template, complex → official charts
2. **Community**: Higher star repositories = proven configurations
3. **Flexibility**: Custom needs → app-template, standard needs → official charts
4. **Maintenance**: Repository activity and chart update frequency

### **Tool Reference**

**scripts/app-scout.sh Commands:**
```bash
# Discovery commands (JSON output)
scripts/app-scout.sh discover <chart-name>

# Configuration fetching (human-readable output)
scripts/app-scout.sh inspect <chart-name> --repo <repo-name> --files helmrelease,values
```

**Database Location:** `scripts/repos.db` and `scripts/repos-extended.db`

## Authentik Migration Plan

### **Migration Strategy Overview**

**Approach**: Parallel deployment with gradual service transition to avoid disrupting 12+ authenticated Docker services managed by SWAG auto proxy.

### **Directory Structure**
```
kubernetes/
├── components/common/sops/
│   ├── cluster-secrets.sops.yaml  # SECRET_DOMAIN (existing)
│   └── email-secrets.sops.yaml    # Shared SMTP configuration (new)
└── apps/default/
    ├── kustomization.yaml
    └── authentik/                 # Self-contained authentication stack
        ├── ks.yaml                # Single HelmRelease for entire stack
        └── app/
            ├── helmrelease.yaml   # HelmRepository + HelmRelease + values
            ├── kustomization.yaml
            └── secret.sops.yaml   # Authentik-specific secrets only
```

### **Stack Components**
Single HelmRelease deploying complete Authentik ecosystem:
- **PostgreSQL**: Database backend (included in Helm chart)
- **Redis**: Task queue and caching (included in Helm chart) 
- **Authentik Server**: Web UI and API endpoints
- **Authentik Worker**: Background task processing

### **Secret Management Strategy**

**Centralized Email Configuration**:
```yaml
# kubernetes/components/common/sops/email-secrets.sops.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Secret
metadata:
  name: email-secrets
  namespace: flux-system
stringData:
  SMTP_HOST: <sops-encrypted>
  SMTP_PORT: <sops-encrypted>
  SMTP_USERNAME: <sops-encrypted>
  SMTP_PASSWORD: <sops-encrypted>
  SMTP_FROM: <sops-encrypted>
  SMTP_USE_TLS: <sops-encrypted>
  SMTP_USE_SSL: <sops-encrypted>
  SMTP_TIMEOUT: <sops-encrypted>
```

**Service Integration Pattern**:
```yaml
# HelmRelease values reference secrets via postBuild substitution
values:
  authentik:
    email:
      host: "${SMTP_HOST}"
      username: "${SMTP_USERNAME}"
      password: "${SMTP_PASSWORD}"
      from: "${SMTP_FROM}"
```

### **SWAG Auto Proxy Integration Analysis**

**Current Docker Pattern**:
- 12+ media services use `swag_auth=authentik` labels
- SWAG handles reverse proxy + authentication via nginx auth_request
- Services include: sabnzbd, qbittorrent, prowlarr, sonarr, radarr, bazarr, tautulli
- API endpoints bypass authentication with `swag_auth_bypass=/api`

**Migration Compatibility**:
- K8s Authentik will be completely isolated from Docker services initially
- SWAG will continue authenticating Docker services during transition
- Progressive service migration maintains authentication continuity

### **Deployment Phases**

**Phase 1: Parallel Testing**
- Deploy K8s Authentik with `auth-test.${SECRET_DOMAIN}` subdomain
- HTTPRoute with `parentRefs: internal` for cluster-only access
- Fresh PostgreSQL instance (migrate data later)
- Test authentication flows without affecting production

**Phase 2: Service Migration**
- As each Docker service migrates to K8s, update authentication integration
- Docker services continue using Docker Authentik via SWAG
- K8s services use K8s Authentik via HTTPRoute middleware

**Phase 3: Authentication Switchover** 
- Switch K8s Authentik to `auth.${SECRET_DOMAIN}`
- Export/import user data from Docker PostgreSQL
- Update any remaining Docker services to point to K8s Authentik
- Decommission Docker Authentik stack

### **Technical Implementation Details**

**Chart Selection**: Official Authentik Helm chart (61 community deployments)
- Repository pattern from carpenike/k8s-gitops (278 stars)
- Chart version 2023.10.2 (matching community examples)
- Proven configuration with integrated PostgreSQL and Redis
- HelmRepository co-located with application following repository conventions

**Self-Contained Application Structure**:
- HelmRepository and HelmRelease in single helmrelease.yaml file
- All application resources contained within single directory
- Follows established patterns (cilium, metrics-server) for easy management
- Fresh start approach - no existing data migration required

**Testing Configuration**:
- Subdomain: `auth-test.${SECRET_DOMAIN}` 
- External access via Cloudflare tunnel
- Database: Rook Ceph storage for persistence
- Email: Preserve existing Gmail SMTP configuration

**Data Migration Requirements**:
- Current PostgreSQL data: `/Volumes/docker/authentik/database_v16`
- Custom templates: Empty directory (no migration needed)
- GeoIP data: Empty directory (no migration needed)
- Media files: Empty public directory (no migration needed)

## Progress & Context Log

### 2025-07-06 - Authentik Database Authentication Issues Resolved

Successfully diagnosed and fixed Authentik deployment authentication failures through systematic investigation using kubectl exec commands.

PostgreSQL Issue Resolved: Found that authentik user password was not properly set during database initialization. Used postgres superuser to reset authentik user password to 'authentik-db-password'. Verified connection works with: `PGPASSWORD=authentik-db-password psql -U authentik -d authentik -c "SELECT 'Connection successful'"`.

Redis Issue Identified: After PostgreSQL fix, discovered Redis authentication failures due to missing password configuration in Authentik values. HelmRelease authentik.redis section only had host but no password field. Added `password: ${REDIS_PASSWORD}` to fix Redis connectivity.

Configuration Changes: Modified kubernetes/apps/default/authentik/app/helmrelease.yaml to include Redis password substitution. Change is staged locally and ready for push after user approval.

Authentik Migration Complete: Full deployment successful with working authentication. All components operational - PostgreSQL, Redis, authentik-server, authentik-worker pods Running/Ready. HTTPRoute active at auth-test.dailey.app via Cloudflare tunnel. Admin credentials (akadmin/admin123) tested and verified working. Ready for service integration and production migration to auth.dailey.app subdomain.

### 2025-07-05 - Authentik Migration Planning Finalized

Completed comprehensive Authentik migration planning including analysis, architecture decisions, and repository pattern standardization. Established self-contained application structure following repository conventions with co-located HelmRepository resources.

Key decisions: Self-contained app structure in kubernetes/apps/default/authentik/, HelmRepository co-located with HelmRelease following cilium/metrics-server patterns, centralized email secrets in kubernetes/components/common/sops/ for cross-app reuse, fresh start deployment approach avoiding data migration complexity.

Updated CLAUDE.md with Helm Repository Management Protocol and Database Isolation Protocol to establish consistent patterns for future service migrations. Plan maintains service availability through parallel deployment strategy while enabling systematic service transition.

### 2025-07-05 - App Scout Research Tool Refactoring Complete

Successfully completed comprehensive refactoring of app-scout.py script implementing approved two-phase discovery system. Script now provides discover command for complete landscape analysis and inspect command for targeted file fetching using exact GitHub paths.

Key improvements: Replaced legacy commands with unified landscape approach, implemented GitHub CLI integration for file operations eliminating rate limiting issues, added exact file path discovery removing configuration guesswork, comprehensive error handling and validation throughout.

Script capabilities: Discovery phase shows complete landscape view for any app including dedicated charts vs app-template usage patterns, inspection phase provides targeted file fetching using exact repository paths from discovery data. Testing with authentik and plex demonstrated different usage patterns and successful file retrieval.

Tool now provides infrastructure needed for informed migration decisions with community-proven configurations as starting points. Ready to begin systematic service migration analysis.

### 2025-07-05 - Rook Ceph Storage Infrastructure Completion

Rook Ceph cluster achieved full operational status with HEALTH_OK across all components. Successfully resolved OSD creation issues by implementing stable device identifiers using /dev/disk/by-id/ paths instead of volatile device filters.

Key achievements: All 3 OSDs operational (rias 2TB, nami 2TB, marin 1TB), ~5TB total storage available, wipeDevicesFromOtherClusters enabled for device cleaning, rias VM memory increased to 8GB. Storage infrastructure foundation complete with both NFS and Ceph systems ready for applications.

### 2025-07-05 - NFS Infrastructure Deployment

NFS infrastructure successfully merged to main branch and deployed via Flux GitOps. All three static PersistentVolumes (media-pv, photos-pv, filerun-pv) are now available in the cluster with proper NFSv4.1 configurations.

### 2025-07-04 - NFS Infrastructure Implementation

Completed NFS infrastructure setup with static PersistentVolumes for existing Unraid data. Created comprehensive storage structure with three main PVs: media-pv (100Ti), photos-pv (10Ti), and filerun-pv (5Ti) pointing to existing Nezuko shares.

Implemented security configurations with NFSv4.1 and Private mode for local network access. PVs configured with ReadWriteMany access mode for shared storage access patterns. All configurations follow repository conventions with proper labeling and documentation.

### 2025-07-02 - App Scout Research Tooling Implementation

Created comprehensive app-scout.py tool for systematic service migration analysis. Tool provides programmatic access to kubesearch.dev community data with 6,395+ app-template deployments and examples from 38+ repositories.

Implemented 4-step migration methodology: discovery → configuration analysis → Docker Compose comparison → implementation decision. Tool fetches actual HelmRelease and values.yaml files from community repositories for direct configuration comparison.

Key capabilities: search charts by popularity, fetch configurations from specific repositories, analyze app-template vs official chart usage patterns, export JSON data for programmatic analysis. Database files (repos.db, repos-extended.db) stored in scripts directory with relative path resolution.

Established systematic approach for all future service migrations using community-proven configurations as starting points. Ready to begin individual service analysis and migration planning.

### 2025-06-30 - Rook Ceph Infrastructure Implementation

Implemented Rook Ceph storage infrastructure following repository conventions. Created complete directory structure with operator and cluster components using official Helm charts. Fixed Talos disk selector ambiguity on rias node with size filter. 

Resolved multiple YAML configuration conflicts by analyzing repository patterns and removing inline values from HelmReleases. Added proper top-level monitoring configuration for Helm chart Prometheus integration alongside cephClusterSpec monitoring.

Rook Ceph cluster deployment completed successfully. All storage components operational with proper monitoring integration. Storage classes configured for SSD performance tier. Infrastructure foundation ready for next phase components.
