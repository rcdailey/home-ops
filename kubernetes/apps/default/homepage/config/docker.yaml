# Docker configuration for Homepage
# This file configures Docker container integrations for the homepage dashboard.
# When running with Docker Compose, this would contain Docker socket configuration
# to display container status, resource usage, and management controls.
#
# Docker integration is disabled for this public landing page deployment.
# This prevents exposure of container information to unauthenticated users.
#
# Homepage requires this file to exist even when empty.
