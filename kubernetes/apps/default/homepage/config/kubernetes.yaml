# Kubernetes integration configuration for Homepage
# This file configures how Homepage interacts with the Kubernetes cluster
# to display cluster information and resource metrics.
#
# Mode options:
# - cluster: Shows cluster-wide information (CPU, memory, node count, etc.)
# - disabled: Disables Kubernetes integration entirely
#
# With cluster mode enabled, the kubernetes widget in widgets.yaml can display:
# - Cluster CPU and memory usage
# - Node status and count
# - Pod counts across namespaces
# - Cluster health information
#
# Homepage uses the service account token mounted in the pod to authenticate
# with the Kubernetes API server.
mode: disabled
