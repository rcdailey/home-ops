# NFS client mount options configuration
#
# Using nconnect=4 for optimal balance between throughput and connection stability.
# Higher values (8, 16) cause NFS client request distribution imbalance leading to
# connection-specific stalls that manifest as 30-second timeouts.
#
# Industry best practices (NetApp, VMware, Azure, Red Hat KB 6998955):
# - nconnect=4: Optimal for most workloads including streaming
# - nconnect=8: Maximum recommended value
# - nconnect=16: Known to cause performance degradation with sequential I/O
